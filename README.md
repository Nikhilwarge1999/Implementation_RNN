app.py
This file is used to create a Streamlit web application for deploying the RNN model. It allows users to input text (movie reviews) and receive a sentiment prediction (positive or negative).

model.py
This file contains the implementation of the RNN model using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The model is trained on the IMDB dataset to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.

utils.py
Contains utility functions for loading and preprocessing the IMDB dataset. This includes tokenizing the text, padding sequences, and converting the text into numerical form for use in the model.

Steps
1. Load the IMDB Dataset
The IMDB dataset consists of 25,000 movie reviews, labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is preprocessed by tokenizing the text, padding sequences to ensure uniform input size, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. Build the RNN Model
The RNN model typically consists of the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
LSTM Layer: Captures the sequential dependencies in the data.
Dense Layer: Final output layer with a sigmoid activation function to classify the sentiment as either positive or negative.
3. Train the Model
The model is trained on the IMDB dataset to learn the relationships between the words in the reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive/negative). The training process involves minimizing a binary cross-entropy loss function, using the Adam optimizer.

4. Create a Streamlit Web App
The Streamlit web application provides a simple interface for users to input a movie review and receive a sentiment prediction from the trained RNN model. Users can interact with the app to test the model with different text inputs.

5. Run the Streamlit App
Once the model is trained and the app is set up, you can run the Streamlit web application. This will start a local server, allowing users to enter movie reviews and get predictions from the model.

6. Deploy the App
The application can be deployed to cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku for public access. This allows anyone to interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface.

Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing of the IMDB dataset includes:

Tokenization: Breaking the text into words or tokens.
Padding: Ensuring all input sequences are of equal length, which is essential for feeding data into the RNN.
Text-to-Sequence Conversion: Transforming words into numerical representations that the model can process.
